#This is A Matrix DataType

**Methods for Creating a Matrix**

>Matrices (int, int)

```
a=Matrices(2,2)
```

this will create a matrix of order 2x2 and we can create a matrix of any order using this for example we have to create a matrix of order 3x4 then the syntax would be- 

```
a=Matrices(3,4)
```

after this prompt will ask you to enter the values inside that matrix give the values and finally your Matrix is created

>Matrices.fromxstr(string)

```
a=Matrices.fromxstr("3x3")
```
this will create a matrix of order 3x3 and we can create a matrix of any order using this for example we have to create a matrix of order 3x4 then the syntax would be- 

```a=Matrices.fromxstr("3x4")```

**Printing the Matrix**

>print(obj.show)
```print(obj.show)```

for example obj is object of Matrix them obj.show will return a matrix and on printing it will return a matrix.

>print(obj.matrix)

this will return a list of list

**Number of elements in a matrix**

```len(obj)```

supporse obj is an object of matrices type the on running this fx will return number of elements in a matrix

##arithmetic operations

>Addition

``` obj1 + obj2 ```

considering both are object of Matrices class

>Subtraction

``` obj1 - obj2```
considering both are object of Matrices class

>Multipulication

``` obj1 * obj2```
considering both are object of Matrices class

>Transpose

```obj1.transpose```
considering both are object of Matrices class

**Finding Order of Matrix**

```obj1.order```

on printing obj1.order will give order of matrix
